These are helpers for general data cleaning and for some specific webby cleaning stuff.

Functions

* `get(url)`: Make a get request for a url and cache it,
    or load it from a cache if it has already been downloaded.
* `randomsleep(mean = 8, sd = 4)`: Sleep for a normal-random
    number of seconds.
* `fromstring` and `HtmlElement`: These are extended versions of the
    respective components of `lxml.html` that provide two extra functions:
  * `HtmlElement.one_xpath`: Select one node based on an xpath; return
      an error if multiple or no nodes match this xpath.
  * `HtmlElement.one_cssselect` Select one node based on a css selector;
      return an error if multiple or no nodes match this xpath.
* `digits(text)`: Extract the digits from some text.
* `cache(key, func)`: Look up the key in the cache. If it exists, load it from
    there. Otherwise, cache the output of the function and return it.
* `read_csv`: Like R's read.csv; produces a list of dicts from CSV.
* `usps`: Looks up address using usps.com's ZIP code lookup.
* `dateparse`: parse dates with dateutil, but raise exceptions if incomplete date.
